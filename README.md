# QuantumCrypt
 QuantumCrypt is an interactive Gradio app that simulates quantum-safe encryption using BB84-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), real-time Fernet encryption/decryption, QR code sharing, intrusion detection via quantum circuits, and visualization of key randomness and noise, bringing quantum principles into practical cybersecurity.
